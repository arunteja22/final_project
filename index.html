<h3>Project Title: Vehicle Sales</h3>
<p>Our idea is to present how car sales affected with respect to the different types of vehicles with different models, horsepower and prices.</p>
<p>Every year, many models of cars are released, and every vehicle has a unique thing about them. Some cars’ exterior looks stunning, and some vehicles’ ride quality could be good, but if you see the sales of cars every year, there will be few cars that exceed the year’s sales. Do you know why? Our idea is to give you a brief understanding of the sales of the vehicles</p>
